 A mighty small, 45% ortholinear keyboard
 
 The Little_Foot is a project of mine that I made as a personal challange.  In both some tray-mounting design, as well as some more complex firmware/code construction.
 
Trying to push the limit of how small I could realistically go, I wanted to dive more into chording, combos, layer tapping and LED configuration, all without making something *overlly complicated*.  

Overall, I'm pretty happy with the outcome.  :)
